2.objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

Objects are important data types in javascript. 
Objects are different than primitive datatypes i.e. number, string, boolean, etc. 
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, 
respectively in the context of an object.

Every object has some property associated with some value. 
These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

Objects are unordered collections of related data, 
of primitive or reference types

An object can be created with figure brackets {} with an optional list of properties.
A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is the property name value can be anything.

construction function-

function Person(name, age, eye) {
this.Name = name;
this.age = age;
this.eyeColor = eye;
}

creating new object my car-

var myCar = new Object();

myCar.name = 'Suzuki';

myCar.model = 'Altros';

myCar.year = 1999;

myCar.wheels = 4;

After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

i.e.

myCar.year

Output: 1999

These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.

myCar[year]

Output: 1999
