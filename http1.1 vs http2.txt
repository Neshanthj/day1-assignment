1.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & 
it is used in client-server communication.

HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. 
HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, 
while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.

HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format, 
while still maintaining HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers. 
As opposed to HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text format.

HTTP/1.1

-It works on the textual format.

-There is head of line blocking that blocks 
all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.

-It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages

-It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2

-It works on the binary protocol.

-It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

-It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 

-It uses HPACK for data compression.
